**What is Motivation?**|
The Oxford Dictionary defines motivation as “the mental processes that direct, sustain, and arouse human behavior.” It’s a fundamental component that has ensured our survival and evolution as a species. When we were hungry, we were motivated to hunt. When we were thirsty, we were motivated to quench our thirst. But this relationship isn’t as straightforward for more abstract and secondary goals.

**Motivation in Society:**|
Today our goals and realities are a lot more complex than just merely survival. All around us, motivation is celebrated as the driving force behind success. We see motivational speeches, books, and quotes plastered across social media, promising to reignite our drive and help us conquer life’s challenges. Unfortunately, those people are only partially correct. Recent research from Yale University proves that “goals are more likely to be successful in the long term if they’re intrinsically motivated.”Yet, if you’ve ever relied solely on motivation to achieve a goal, you’ve likely noticed how quickly it fades. The secret to long-lasting success isn’t motivation — it’s identity.

**Problem with Motivation:**|
Motivation is a fleeting emotion. It’s often influenced by external circumstances, moods, or energy levels, making it unreliable as a long-term strategy for success. Once a shift in your mood shifts, there will be fluctuations with your levels of motivation. Research from the National Institute of Health (NIH) shows that motivation peaks when we set new goals but quickly diminishes as the initial excitement wears off. In fact, “by mid-February, according to the U.S. News & World Report, most people have lost their commitment and overall, the failure rate is 80% for those resolutions!” (NIH). Maybe you’ve identified with 80% as well in the past. This year, it’s time to try something new!

**Advantages of Identity Shifts:**|
Rather than relying on bursts of motivation, lasting change comes from shifting your identity. For example, say your goal is to go to the gym more. Instead of saying, “I want to workout,” shift your thinking to, “I am an active and healthy person.” This subtle shift makes the desired behavior part of who you are, not just something you do occasionally. Consequently, it will spark motivation as your mind does not want to disprove something that is ingrained into your personality. Thus, in this scenario, you will be more motivated to workout and achieve better outcomes. In Atomic Habits, James Clear emphasizes this point: “The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say, ‘I’m the type of person who wants this.’ It’s something very different to say, ‘I’m the type of person who is this.’” Similarly, Charles Duhigg, author of The Power of Habit, explains how identity plays a critical role in habit formation: “When people believe in their ability to change — and believe in habits aligned with their identity — it creates a framework for achieving lasting results”. The key takeaway here is that identity based habits are your transportation to achieving your destination or goal.

**How to Shift Your Identity:**|
Here are some practical steps to focus on identity rather than motivation:
Define Who You Want to Be: Identify the kind of person who achieves the goals you’re pursuing. Back to our previous example, if your goal is to go to the gym more, your identity shift might be, “I am someone who prioritizes health.”
Focus on Small Wins: Each time you take an action aligned with your new identity, you reinforce it. Completing a single workout reinforces the identity of being someone who exercises.
Use Identity-Based Affirmations: Instead of saying, “I’ll try to work out three times this week,” say, “I am someone who never misses a workout.” This subtle language shift can have a profound impact on your mindset.
Surround Yourself with Reinforcements: Align your environment and community to support your identity. Joining a group of runners or subscribing to health-related content can help solidify your identity as someone who values fitness.
Be Patient and Consistent: Identity change takes time. The more decisions in alignment to your new identity, the easier it will become.

**Why this works:**|
	When behaviors are rooted in identity, they become automatic. If you identify as someone who values learning, reading books or taking courses becomes second nature. Identity provides the foundation for consistency, which ultimately leads to success. As James Clear says, “every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.” Research from Mindset: The New Psychology of Success by Carol S. Dweck further supports the concept of identity-based growth. Dweck’s studies show that adopting a growth mindset — the belief that you can improve and align with a new identity — is critical to achieving success.

**Closing thoughts:**|
	Motivation will always play a role in our lives, but it should never be the foundation for achieving meaningful change. Instead, focus on shifting your identity and aligning your actions with the person you aspire to become. This approach not only sustains your efforts but also makes the journey more fulfilling.
